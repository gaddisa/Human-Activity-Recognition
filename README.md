## Overview

Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a project aimed at detecting and classifying human activities from mobile sensor data using deep learning techniques.

---
## Problem Statement:

Human Activity Recognition (HAR) is a significant area of research aimed at detecting and classifying human activities based on sensor data collected from wearable devices such as smartphones or smartwatches. The goal is to develop algorithms that can accurately identify different activities performed by individuals, such as walking, running, sitting, standing, etc., based on the patterns present in the sensor data.

## Implementation Details:
To implement the HAR project, I have developed a custom neural network structure entirely from scratch using pure Python code. This approach eliminates the dependency on external libraries or frameworks and allows complete control over the model architecture and optimization process.

The custom neural network architecture includes layers for data input, fully connected (dense) layers, activation functions (such as ReLU), and optimization algorithms (such as Adam, SGD, and Adagrad). The model is trained using backpropagation and gradient descent techniques to minimize the loss function and optimize the model parameters.

By implementing the neural network from scratch, I aim to deepen my understanding of deep learning concepts and algorithms while providing a flexible and customizable framework for human activity recognition tasks.
