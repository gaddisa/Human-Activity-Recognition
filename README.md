## Explanation

### Data Collection
Mobile sensor data, including accelerometer and gyroscope readings, were collected from smartphones worn by individuals during various activities.

### Data Preprocessing
Raw sensor data underwent preprocessing steps such as noise removal, normalization, and feature extraction to prepare it for model training.

### Model Development
Deep learning models were developed using TensorFlow to classify human activities based on preprocessed sensor data.

### Model Evaluation
The performance of the models was assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics on a separate test dataset.

### Deployment
The trained models were deployed for real-time activity recognition on mobile devices, allowing for on-the-go monitoring and analysis.
